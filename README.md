# 🌍 Smart Travel AI

Welcome to **Smart Travel AI** — a side project where I combined my love for travel, design, and AI into one sleek web app.

This is a modern travel planner that builds **luxury, personalized itineraries** in seconds. It’s powered by **GPT-4**, styled with a **custom-tailored UI**, and built for speed, elegance, and responsiveness.

You enter your preferences → the AI plans your trip → you export it to PDF and go live your best life.
